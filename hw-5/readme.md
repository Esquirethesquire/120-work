[Abstract Animation](https://alexk2313.github.io/120-work/hw-5/);

# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During homework five we learned about basic animations, variables, and the proper way to keep code neat and organized. We then went on to use these to create either an abstract drawing or a character. I chose to use them to create an abstract drawing.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 5 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created the abstract sketch.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
The issues i had this week came when i was trying to use the rotate functions. Getting the square to actually do what i want took quite a bit of trial and error but i was able to get it down.

## Interest
Im sure there are a multitude of applications for animation that we dont know about yet and i am very excited to learn some more about them. For instance how we can make circles stay within the bounds of the canvace and bounce around, that would be interesting.

## Assisting
I made a short responce to someone on the issues forum who was having trouble with atom overworking their computer. I suggested the close all other programs and tabs while they are working for the class.

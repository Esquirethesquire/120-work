["Hello World!" Sketch](https://alexk2313.github.io/120-work/hw-3/empty-example/)

# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During the third week of work within this class i learned alot of information about P5 code and some information about java script and html.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 3 assignments.
2. Created the "Hello World" sketch that we were instructed on.
3. Set up my github URL and provided the link to this document.

## Issues
The only issue i had this week was while creating the new directories. I was creating them within atom and now within the file explorer. I somehow got an extra layer within my hw-3 folder and instead of going back deleting the folder and starting all over, i jsut added the extra line of text to my URL to display the assignment.

## Interest
The one thing we talked about that i would like to discuss further is the applications of the draw() function. I find it very interesting.

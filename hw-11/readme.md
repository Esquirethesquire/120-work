# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During week eleven we learned about OOP(Object Oriented Programing) and how we can combine classes and arrays to create as many objects as desired.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 11 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created my drawing by first creating the class. I then went on to use an array to create a multitude of objects within the canvas that are moving randomly and all growing or shrinking in size.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
I was having the hardest time getting any objects to show up on my canvas. I spent hours trying to fix this problem and finaly realized i had to give my objects a starting point within my for statement in the setup function!
## Interest
i want to experiment with the use of OOP in making simple games. I cant wait to put this knowledge to use.

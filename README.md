# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During week 4 we covered the basics of drawing within P5. This includes different shapes and how to use them, colors, grids, etc.) We used this information to create a monster portrait or a self portrait using code.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. familiarized myself with the basics of drawing in P5.
2. created my HW-4 folder in my repo.
3. created my self portrait using what we learned about drawing in P5.
4. Set up my github URL and provided the link to this document.

## Issues
I just had small issues where i would get errors in my code. All the fixes for these issues were simple and were often taken care of within a few minutes. One issue i responded to this week was a question about the read me documents we have to write every week. I told a fellow student that the best thing to do every week would be to probably reuse the same template every week for the weekly responce. I assume this would be the easiest and smartest way to complete them. 

## Interest
Starting off i was having a hard time memorizing all of the different shapes and the values used to create them, but once i got started on the homework i got used to them and started wondering about all the other uses for drawing within P5. Im sure we will learn a lot more information about P5 and i am really looking forward to it/

For my final project i plan to make a game like the 1978 arcade game "asteroid" but set inside p5. My insperation for this project is the time i spent playing the game as a kid and having things that ive always wanted to change about it.

I know there are a couple things i will need to research in order to make this work. First, i will need to figure out how to make objects move by using the arrow keys. Secondly, i will need to research how to make my "spaceship" shoot out objects that can colide and make other objects disappear and split. The last thing being how to get objects to split into smaller objects.

I have already done some of the preliminary research on how to get objects to move by using the arrow keys. There is still alot done and i will use the next couple days to figure out the complicated code that makes the game work. I plan to finish the game a couple days early so i can make small adjustments that make the game more personal and visually appealing.

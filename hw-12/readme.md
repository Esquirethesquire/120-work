# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During week twelve we learned more about OOP(Object Oriented Programing), how we can interact with objects, and how we can make objects interact with eachother. I chose to create a canvas with the circles that move randomly, and grow and shrink. They change color when interacting with the walls of the canvas and with eachother.
## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 11 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created my drawing by creating two circles from an array by using my class that i created.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
Getting the objects to interact with eachother took me quite awhile to figure out. Every time i would add a section of code that was "supposed" to make them interactive, the circles just wouldnt show up on the canvas anymore. I was getting no errors in the console so i dont know what it could have been.
## Interest
Knowing more about the interaction of unique objects in code makes me think im one step closer to understanding ways to make more interactive and basic games.

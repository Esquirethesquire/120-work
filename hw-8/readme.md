# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During week eight we learned how to simplify our code by using for and while loops.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 8 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created my drawing using nested for loops.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
Through trial and error i was able to figure out most of the content this week apply it to my drawing. It was all pretty straight forward. The only issues i had were when i was trying to animate the stuff within my loops. Im assuming we will learn more about this soon.
## Interest
I really want to learn more about animation within for and while loops so i can make my new objects move.

# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During week ten we learned how to use arrays and functions to simplify our code.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 9 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created my drawing using an array and a custom function to draw random circles on the x axis that decend along the y axis.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
Through trial and error i was able to figure out most of the content this week apply it to my drawing. I had some small issues in working through typos and getting the array to work properly. Other than that there were no issues.
## Interest
I want to spend time learning more applications of custom functions and arrays within code. I will spend some time researching and finding new uses for them.

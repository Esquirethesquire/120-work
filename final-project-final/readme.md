# Final Project

## Intro
My final project was influenced by the the retro arcade game "Asteroids". I played the game alot in my childhood and ive always had a game idea that has stemed from the original. In my game you control a ship/character. In the game you run from orbs that float around the screen but you are also confined to the edges of the screen. If you are caught by the orbs you lose the game and have to restart.

## Research
When i first began making my game i realized there was alot that goes into it. I realized with some of the mechanics i had no idea how to program them to actually work. Some of the mechanics im referencing are, a momentum mechanic that makes your ship continue moving even after you tell it to stop, collision mechanics, and how to insert sound into my game.

I began my research and found many Shiffman videos that delt with the problems i was having. I was able to solve most of my problems by adapting the concepts that he was disscusing in his tutorials.

## Making of
I started my project by programing my ship class that my ship/character object was based from.

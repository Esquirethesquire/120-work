# Weekly Experiences
## Summary
During homework six we learned about alot of math basics and math functions. we used these within our own code to create an algorithmic art piece.

## Steps
The steps i took to complete this weeks assignment are as follows:
1. Created a file for the homework 6 assignment.
2. Worked through all the content on the website.
2. Created the algorithmic drawing.
3. Submitted and provided the links to this document.

## Issues
I had an uncountable amount of small issues this week, which i think is justifiable due to the content. Some examples of issues were getting the "objects" i put in my code to work properly. I recieved many error messages during this assignment but were all corrected through trial and error.
## Interest
There were a couple of irritating things this week. I couldnt figure out how to create a set boundary for my two shapes to stay within. To correct this i made my two shapes move diagonally to the bottom right of my screan and used modulos to set those two sides as boundaries. I believe there is a better way of setting boundaries for our algorithmic sketches and i can wait to learn about them.

## Assisting
One of my fellow classmates needed help with hyperlinking our urls for our assignments. So i walked him through the process and made it very clear on how to properly hyperlink.
